# CT Scan Pre-Processing to Enhance PAA Segmentation Accuracy

## Abstract

Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) are focal dilations of the popliteal artery that pose a significant risk of rupture
and limb loss. Accurate segmentation of PAAs from computed tomography (CT) scans is crucial for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. However, the presence of noise, intensity variations, and artifacts in CT images can hinder the
performance of segmentation algorithms. This research investigates the effectiveness of preprocessing techniques in
enhancing the segmentation accuracy of knee CT scans for PAA diagnosis and management. A comprehensive analysis of
current preprocessing methods, their limitations, and potential advancements is presented. The study employs a dataset
of knee CT scans with PAAs and applies various preprocessing techniques, including noise reduction, intensity
normalization, and contrast enhancement. The impact of these techniques on segmentation accuracy is evaluated using
metrics such as Dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance. The results demonstrate that preprocessing
significantly improves PAA segmentation accuracy, with specific techniques showing superior performance. The findings
highlight the importance of incorporating preprocessing as a critical step in the PAA segmentation pipeline and provide
insights into future research directions for enhancing the robustness and generalizability of these techniques. This
research aims to contribute to the advancement of PAA diagnosis and treatment planning, ultimately leading to improved
patient outcomes.

## Background

PAAs are focal dilations of the popliteal artery, often associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms and carrying a
significant risk of rupture, which can lead to limb loss. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for timely
intervention and preventing complications. CT imaging is widely used for detecting and evaluating PAAs, but the
complexity of the knee joint's anatomy and the presence of noise, intensity variations, and artifacts can pose
challenges for precise segmentation and diagnosis.

Pre-processing techniques, such as noise reduction, intensity normalization, contrast enhancement, and artifact removal,
have shown promising results in improving the quality of medical images and enhancing the performance of segmentation
algorithms. By addressing these issues, preprocessing can potentially facilitate more accurate delineation of PAAs and
surrounding structures, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Current Limitations and Challenges

Current preprocessing techniques for CT scan segmentation encompass a range of methods, including noise reduction
through techniques like anisotropic diffusion and non-local means filtering, intensity normalization via histogram
matching, and contrast enhancement using adaptive histogram equalization. These techniques have demonstrated efficacy in
improving segmentation accuracy for various applications, such as liver and lung segmentation.

However, several limitations persist in the current state of preprocessing for CT scan segmentation, particularly in
the context of knee CT scans and PAA diagnosis.
These limitations include:

1. **Variability in scanning protocols**: Differences in scanning parameters, equipment, and protocols can lead to
   variations in image quality, affecting the performance of preprocessing techniques and subsequent segmentation
   accuracy.
2. **Complex anatomical structures**: The knee joint and surrounding vascular structures exhibit intricate anatomical
   details and varying intensities, posing challenges for accurate segmentation, even with preprocessing.
3. **Partial volume effects**: Voxels containing a mixture of different tissue types can introduce inaccuracies in
   segmentation, particularly for small structures or aneurysms.
4. **Optimal preprocessing pipeline**: Determining the optimal combination and sequence of preprocessing techniques
   for a specific application or dataset remains a challenge, as different techniques may have varying impacts on
   segmentation accuracy.

To address these limitations and further advance the field of preprocessing for CT scan segmentation, ongoing research
is required to develop adaptive and automated preprocessing pipelines, explore the integration of preprocessing with
deep learning segmentation models, and investigate techniques to mitigate partial volume effects and enhance
generalization across diverse datasets.

## Preprocessing Techniques

For the demonstration of preprocessing techniques, we will use a sample knee CT scan image with a popliteal artery
aneurysm (PAA). The image exhibits typical characteristics of CT scans, including noise, intensity variations, and
artifacts that can affect segmentation accuracy. We will apply a series of preprocessing techniques to enhance the
image quality and prepare it for segmentation.
